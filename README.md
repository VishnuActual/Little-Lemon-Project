# Little Lemon Restaurant API Project

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the scope of the Little Lemon restaurant API project, including all necessary endpoints and implementation notes. It serves as a guide to successfully completing the project and should be referenced during development to ensure adherence to project requirements.

## Scope

The project entails creating a fully functioning API for the Little Lemon restaurant. This API will enable client application developers to develop web and mobile applications. Users with different roles will be able to browse, add and edit menu items, place orders, browse orders, assign delivery crews to orders, and deliver orders.

## Structure

## Function or Class-Based Views

Both function- and class-based views can be utilized in this project. It's essential to follow proper API naming conventions throughout the project. Review the videos on function- and class-based views as well as naming conventions for guidance.

## User Groups

Two user groups, Manager and Delivery Crew, will be created. Users not assigned to a group will be considered customers. Refer to the video on user roles for guidance.
